# DDoS Traffic Visualization

This project is designed to visualize and analyze Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack traffic patterns. It provides insights into network traffic behavior, enabling researchers and security experts to understand and detect DDoS attacks more effectively.

## Features

- **DDoS Traffic Dataset**: Utilizes a dataset containing traffic data, which includes both benign and DDoS attack traffic.
- **Visualization Tools**: Various techniques for visualizing network traffic patterns, including graphs and charts.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Identifies potential DDoS attack characteristics by analyzing traffic patterns.
- **Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to ensure clean and structured data for analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yagizterzi/DdosTrafficVisualization.git
   cd DdosTrafficVisualization
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Load the traffic dataset:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_traffic_data.csv')
   ```

2. Visualize the traffic patterns:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   # Code to generate your desired visualization
   ```

3. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python analyze_traffic.py
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains network traffic data, including features like packet size, protocol type, and timestamps. The data is divided into benign traffic and DDoS attack traffic.
